# BMW-Sales-

This project explores and analyzes BMW car sales dataset using SQL. It was designed to simulate real-world dealership data and strengthen SQL querying skills. This project took 3-4 days to complete.

üìã Project Overview:
Two tables used: dealership and bmw_sales

Contains realistic dealership and vehicle attributes:

Model, year, engine size, fuel type, price, mileage, transmission, etc.

SQL database: MySQL

üîß Key SQL Concepts Practiced:
JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY

Filtering with WHERE, pattern matching with LIKE

Aggregate functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG)

Window functions and CTEs (not shown here, but practiced)

üîç Sample Queries:
Top-selling models per dealership

Electric or hybrid cars sold

Dealerships selling more than 3 vehicles

Oldest & newest cars sold

Cheapest car per dealership

Engine size stats per model

This project helps visualize how structured relational data (like car inventories and sales records) can be analyzed using SQL in a real-world scenario.
